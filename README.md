# Shortcode

Shortcode is a ruby gem for parsing Wordpress style shortcodes, I created it while building a CMS for a client through [my ruby consultancy, Kernow Soul](http://kernowsoul.com). The gem uses a [PEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) (Parsing Expression Grammar) parser rather than using regular expressions so its easier to understand, test and extend.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shortcode'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install shortcode
```

Shortcode is tested against ruby version 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 as well as jruby (2.x compatible), it will not work with ruby 1.8 and is no longer tested against ruby 1.9. Shortcode rails integration is tested against
Rails versions 4.1, 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1.

## Usage

### Example

Shortcode is very simple to use, simply call the `process` method and pass it a string containing shortcode markup.

You can create multiple instances of `Shortcode` with separate configurations for each, or you can call methods directly on `Shortcode` to use the same configuration throughout.  Throughout this Readme we will refer to calling methods directly on the class as "Singleton", and creating multiple instances as "Instance"

#### Singleton

```ruby
Shortcode.process("[quote]Hello World[/quote]")
```

#### Instance
```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new
shortcode.process("[quote]Hello World[/quote]")
```

In a Rails app, you can create helper methods to handle your shortcoded content and use them in your views with something similar to `<%= content_html @page.content %>`. Those two helper method can be used if your content contains html to be escaped or not.

```ruby
module PagesHelper
  def content(c)
    Shortcode.process(c)
  end

  def content_html(c)
    raw content(c)
  end
end
```

### Tags

Any tags you wish to use with Shortcode need to be configured in the setup block, there are 2 types of tag, `block_tags` and `self_closing_tags`. Block tags have a matching open and close tag such as `[quote]A quote[/quote]`, self closing tags have no close tag, for example `[gallery]`. To define the tags Shortcode should parse do so in the configuration (in a Rails initializer for example) as follows:

#### Singleton

```ruby
Shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.block_tags = [:quote, :list]
  config.self_closing_tags = [:gallery, :widget]
end
```

#### Instance
```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new
shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.block_tags = [:quote, :list]
  config.self_closing_tags = [:gallery, :widget]
end
```

Note that you can call the setup block multiple times if need be and add to it.

For example:

```ruby
shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.block_tags << :other_tag
end
```

### Templates

Each shortcode tag needs a template in order to translate the shortcode into html (or other output). Templates can be written in erb, haml or slim and work in
a similar way to views in Rails. The main content of a tag is passed via the instance variable `@content`. Any attributes defined on a tag are passed in via an `@attributes` hash, shortcodes can have any number of attributes. For instance a quote shortcode might look like this:

    [quote author="Homer Simpson"]Doh![/quote]

And the erb template to render the shortcode

```erb
<blockquote>
  <p class='quotation'>
    <%= @content %>
  </p>
  <% if @attributes[:author] %>
    <p class='citation'>
      <span class='author'>
        <%= @attributes[:author] %>
      </span>
    </p>
  <% end %>
</blockquote>
```

If using the gem within a Rails project you can use the Rails helper methods within templates.

Shortcodes can be nested inside other shortcodes, there are no limits imposed on the nesting depth. This can be useful when creating complex content such as a collapsible list that can have any content inside each element. We could have the following shortcodes

    [collapsible_list]
      [item]
        [youtube id="12345"]
      [/item]
      [item]Hellow World[/item]
    [/collapsible_list]

Three templates would be required to support the above content, `[:collapsible_list, :item, :youtube]`. Each template is rendered in isolation and has no knowledge of parent or child elements.

There are 2 ways templates can be used with Shortcode, the default it to load templates from the file system, an alternative approach is to pass templates to the setup
block as strings.

#### Templates loaded from the file system

Simply create files with the extension or .erb, .haml, or .slim with a filename the same as the shortcode tag, e.g. gallery.html.erb would render a [gallery] shortcode tag. The default
location for template files is `app/views/shortcode_templates`, if you want to load templates from a different location use the `template_path` config option.

Note: only 1 template parser is supported at a time, if using haml for instance all templates must be haml.

#### Templates set as configuration options

The alternative way to define templates is to set them using the `templates` config option, this option can take a hash with keys of the same name as the shortcode tags and
values containing a template string. For instance:

##### Singleton

```ruby
Shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.templates = { gallery: 'template code' }
end
```

##### Instance

```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new

shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.templates = { gallery: 'template code' }
end
```

If the `templates` config option is set all templates will be loaded from this hash, if a shortcode is encountered without a matching key in the `templates` config option
an exception will be raised.

Note: it's NOT possible to load templates from a config option AND from the file system, you must either load all templates from the file system or define all templates in a config option.

### Custom Helpers

If you wish to use custom helper modules in templates you can do so by specifying the helpers in a setup block which should be an array. Methods in the helper modules will then become available within all templates.

#### Singleton

```ruby
Shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.helpers = [CustomHelper, AnotherCustomHelper]
end
```

#### Instance

```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new

shortcode.setup do |config|
  config.helpers = [CustomHelper, AnotherCustomHelper]
end
```

### Presenters

Sometimes the data passed to the template from the shortcode it not enough. Lets say you want to render a gallery of images using id numbers of images stored in a database, e.g. `[gallery ids="1,2,3,4"]`. This is where presenters can help, they allow you to modify the `@content` and `@attributes` variables before they are sent to the template for rendering. Presenters are simple classes that define four methods. The class method `for` should return the name of the shortcode (as a symbol) it should be applied to, the `for` method can also return an array of symbols if the presenter is to be used for multiple shortcodes. The classes `initialize` method received the `attributes`, `content` and `additional_attributes` variables. Finally the class should define `content` and `attributes` methods.

In a rails app you could return image records to the template using something like this:

```ruby
class GalleryPresenter

  def self.for
    # An array can also be returned if the presenter should be applied
    # to multiple shortcodes, e.g. [:gallery, :enhanced_gallery]
    :gallery
  end

  def initialize(attributes, content, additional_attributes)
    @content = content
  end

  def content
    @content
  end

  def attributes
    { images: images }
  end

  private

  def images
    Image.where("id IN (?)", @attributes[:ids])
  end
end
```

#### Using additional attributes

At times you may want to pass through additional attributes to a presenter, for instance if you have a [gallery] shortcode tag and you want to pull out all images for a post, this can be achieved using additional attributes with a presenter.

```ruby
class GalleryPresenter

  def self.for
    :gallery
  end

  def initialize(attributes, content, additional_attributes)
    @content = content
    @additional_attributes = additional_attributes
  end

  def content
    @content
  end

  def attributes
    { images: images }
  end

  private

  def images
    @additional_attributes[:images].map &:url
  end
end
```

The hash containing the images attribute is passed through to the presenter as the additional_attributes argument to the `process` method.

##### Singleton

```ruby
Shortcode.process('[gallery]', { images: @post.images })
```

##### Instance

```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new
shortcode.process('[gallery]', { images: @post.images })
```

#### Registering presenters

To register a presenter simply call `register_presenter` passing the presenter class e.g.

##### Singleton

```ruby
# A single presenter
Shortcode.register_presenter(CustomPresenter)

# Or multiple presenters in one call
Shortcode.register_presenter(CustomPresenter, AnotherPresenter)
```

##### Instance

```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new

# A single presenter
shortcode.register_presenter(CustomPresenter)

# Or multiple presenters in one call
shortcode.register_presenter(CustomPresenter, AnotherPresenter)
```

### Configuration

The following configuration options can be set for both singleton and instances modes of Shortcode.  You can call `setup` multiple times and modify the existing configuration.

#### Singleton

```ruby
Shortcode.setup do |config|

  # the template parser to use
  config.template_parser = :erb # :erb, :haml, :slim supported, :erb is default

  # location of the template files, default is "app/views/shortcode_templates"
  config.template_path = "support/templates/erb"

  # a hash of templates passed as strings, if this is set it overrides the
  # above template_path option. The default is nil
  config.templates = { gallery: 'template code' }

  # an array of helper modules to make available within templates
  config.helpers = [CustomerHelper]

  # a list of block tags to support e.g. [quote]Hello World[/quote]
  config.block_tags = [:quote]

  # a list of self closing tags to support e.g. [youtube id="12345"]
  config.self_closing_tags = [:youtube]

  # the type of quotes to use for attribute values, default is double quotes (")
  config.attribute_quote_type = '"'

  # Allows quotes around attributes to be omitted
  # Defaults to true, quotes must be present around attribute values
  config.use_attribute_quotes = true
end
```

#### Instance

```ruby
shortcode = Shortcode.new

shortcode.setup do |config|

  # the template parser to use
  config.template_parser = :erb # :erb, :haml, :slim supported, :erb is default

  # location of the template files, default is "app/views/shortcode_templates"
  config.template_path = "support/templates/erb"

  # a hash of templates passed as strings, if this is set it overrides the
  # above template_path option. The default is nil
  config.templates = { gallery: 'template code' }

  # an array of helper modules to make available within templates
  config.helpers = [CustomerHelper]

  # a list of block tags to support e.g. [quote]Hello World[/quote]
  config.block_tags = [:quote]

  # a list of self closing tags to support e.g. [youtube id="12345"]
  config.self_closing_tags = [:youtube]

  # the type of quotes to use for attribute values, default is double quotes (")
  config.attribute_quote_type = '"'

  # Allows quotes around attributes to be omitted
  # Defaults to true, quotes must be present around attribute values
  config.use_attribute_quotes = true
end
